    Get an igraph object from an adjacency or distance matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        A sparse matrix that represents the connectivity or distance matrix for the graph.
        Zero-entries mean "no edge between the two nodes".
    matrix_type
        Whether the `sparse_matrix` represents connectivities (higher value = smaller distance)
        or distances (higher value = higher distance). Distance matrices will be
        converted into connectivities. A connectivity matrix is also known as
        weighted adjacency matrix.
    max_value
        When converting distances to connectivities, this will be considered the
        maximum distance. This defaults to `numpy.max(sparse_matrix)`.
    simplify
        Make an undirected graph and remove circular edges (i.e. edges from
        a node to itself).
