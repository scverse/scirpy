    """Visualize clonal expansion.

    Plots the fraction of cells that belong to an expanded :term:`Clonotype` by
    a categorical variable.

    If `summarize_by` is set to "clone_id" it plots the fraction
    of clonotypes instead of the fraction of cells.

    Removes all entries with `NaN` in `target_col` prior to plotting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        AnnData object to work on.
    groupby
        Group by this categorical variable in `adata.obs`.
    target_col
        Column in `adata.obs` containing the clonotype information.
    clip_at
        All entries in `target_col` with more copies than `clip_at`
        will be summarized into a single group.
    expanded_in
        Calculate clonal expansion within groups. To calculate expansion
        within patients, set this to the column containing patient annotation.
        If set to None, a clonotype counts as expanded if there's any cell of the
        same clonotype across the entire dataset. See also :term:`Public clonotype`.
    summarize_by
        Can be either `cell` to count cells belonging to a clonotype (the default),
        or `clone_id` to count clonotypes. The former leads to a over-representation
        of expanded clonotypes but better represents the fraction of expanded cells.
    normalize
        If True, compute fractions rather than reporting
        abosolute numbers.
    show_nonexpanded
        Whether or not to show the fraction of non-expanded cells/clonotypes
    viztype
        `bar` for bars, `barh` for horizontal bars.
    **kwargs
        Additional arguments passed to :func:`scirpy.pl.base.bar`
