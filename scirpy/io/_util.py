.. note::
    Reading data into *Scirpy* has the following constraints:
     * Each cell can have up to four productive chains chains (:term:`Dual IR`):
       two :term:`VJ<V(D)J>` and two :term:`VDJ<V(D)J>` chains. 
     * Excess chains are ignored (those with lowest read count/:term:`UMI` count)
       and cells flagged as :term:`Multichain-cell`.
     * Non-productive chains are ignored. 
     * Chain loci must be valid :term:`IMGT locus names<Chain locus>`.
     * Excess chains, non-productive chains, chains without a CDR3 sequence, 
       or chains with invalid loci are serialized to JSON and stored in the 
       `extra_chains` column. They are not used by scirpy except when exporting 
       the `AnnData` object to AIRR format. 

    For more information, see :ref:`receptor-model`.
