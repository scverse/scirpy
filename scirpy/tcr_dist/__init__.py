    The distance between two sequences is defined as :math:`S_{{1,2}}^{{max}} - S_{{1,2}}`, 
    where :math:`S_{{1,2}}` is the alignment score of sequences 1 and 2 and 
    :math:`S_{{1,2}}^{{max}}` is the max. achievable alignment score of sequences 1 and 2. 
    :math:`S_{{1,2}}^{{max}}` is defined as :math:`\\min(S_{{1,1}}, S_{{2,2}})`. 

    The use of alignment-based distances is heavily inspired by :cite:`TCRdist`. 

    High-performance sequence alignments are calculated leveraging 
    the `parasail library <https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail-python>`_ (:cite:`Daily2016`).  

    Choosing a cutoff:
        Alignment distances need to be viewed in the light of the substitution matrix. 
        The alignment distance is the difference between the actual alignment 
        score and the max. achievable alignment score. For instance, a mutation 
        from *Leucine* (`L`) to *Isoleucine* (`I`) results in a BLOSUM62 score of `2`. 
        An `L` aligned with `L` achieves a score of `4`. The distance is, therefore, `2`.

        On the other hand, a single *Tryptophane* (`W`) mutating into, e.g.
        *Proline* (`P`) already results in a distance of `15`. 

        We are still lacking empirical data up to which distance a CDR3 sequence still 
        is likely to recognize the same antigen, but reasonable cutoffs are `<15`.
