    """Aims to find clonotypes that are the most enriched or depleted in a category.

    Uses Fischer's exact test to rank clonotypes.
    Depends on execution of :func:`scirpy.tl.repertoire_overlap`.
    Adds two dataframes (abundance of clonotypes per sample; pval and logFC for clonotypes) to `uns`

    .. warning::
        
        This is an experimental function and will likely change in the future. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        AnnData object to work on.       
    replicate_col
        Column with batch or sample labels.
    groupby
        The column containing categories that we want to compare and find imbalance between
    case_label
        The label in `groupby` column that we want to compare. 
    control_label
        The label in `groupby` column that we use as a baseline for comparison. If not set
        (None by default), all labels that are not equal to `case_label` make up the baseline. 
    target_col
        The clusters (clonotypes by default) that are imbalanced. 
    additional_hue
        An additional grouping factor. If the `case_label` was tumor for example, this could
        help make a distinction between imbalance in lung and colorectal tumors.
    fraction
        If `True`, compute fractions of abundances relative to the `groupby` column
        rather than reporting abosolute numbers. Alternatively, a column 
        name can be provided according to that the values will be normalized or an iterable
        providing cell weights directly. Setting it to `False` or `None` assigns equal weight
        to all cells.
    inplace
        Whether results should be added to `uns` or returned directly.
    overlap_key
        Under what key should the repertoire overlap results be looked up in `uns`.
        By default it is None to ensure that the overlap tool is executed with the right parameters.
    key_added
        Results will be added to `uns` under this key.


    Returns
    -------
    Two dataframes: abundance of clonotypes per sample; pval and logFC for clonotypes.
