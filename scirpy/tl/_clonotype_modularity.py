    """
    Identifies clonotypes or clonotype clusters consisting of cells that are
    more transcriptionally related than expected by chance by computing the
    :term:`Clonotype modularity`.

    For each clonotype, we compare the number of edges connecting the cells belonging
    to that clonotype in the transcriptomics neighborhood graph with
    the number of edges expeced by chance in a subgraph of the same size.

    We define the *connectivity score* as the log2 of the ratio of actual to
    expected edges. A pseudocount of 1 is added to cope with small subgraphs with 0
    expected edges. Intuitively, a clonotype modularity of `1` means that there are
    twice as many edges in the neighborhood graph than expected by chance.

    .. math::

        \\text{connectivity score} = \\log_2 \\frac{
                                                    |E|_{\\text{actual}} + 1
                                                }{
                                                    |E|_{\\text{expected}} + 1
                                                }

    For each unique clonotype size, the expected number of edges is derived by
    randomly sampling `n_permutation` subgraphs from the transcriptomics neighborhood
    graph. This background distribution is also used to calculate p-values for the
    connectivity scores. By choosing `permutation_test="approx"`, a negative
    binomial distribution is fitted to the background distribution and used to
    calculate p-values.

    The `clonotype_modularity` function inspired by CoNGA :cite:`Schattgen2021`,
    however, while CoNGA creates "conga clusters" based on cells that share edges in
    the TCR and transcriptomics neighborhood graph, `clonotype_modularity` uses
    predefined clonotype clusters and checks if within those clusters, the transcriptomics
    neighborhood graph is more connected than expected by chance.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental function that may change in the future

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        annotated data matrix
    target_col
        Column in `adata.obs` containing the clonotype annotation.
    connectivity_key
        Key in`adata.obsp` containing the transcriptomics neighborhood graph
        connectivity matrix.
    permutation_test
        Whether to perform an approximate or exact permutation test. If the approximate
        permutation test is used, the result of fewer permutations is used to fit
        a negative binomial distribution, from which p-values are derived.
    n_permutations
        Number of permutations used for the permutations test. Defaults to `1000` for
        the approx test, and to `10000` for the exact test. Note that for the exact
        test, the minimum achievable p-values is `1/n`.
    key_added
        Key under which the result will be stored in `adata.obs` if inplace is `True`.
    fdr_correction
        Whether to adjust the p-values for multiple testing using false-discovery-rate
        (FDR) correction.
    random_state
        random seed for permutation test

    Returns
    -------
    If `inplace` is False, returns two dictionaries mapping the clonotype id onto
    a single modularity score and p-value per clonotype. Otherwise, adds two columns
    to `adata.obs`

       * `adata.obs["{key_added}"]`: the modularity scores for each cell
       * `adata.obs["{key_added}_pvalue"]` or `adata.obs["{key_added}_fdr"]` with the
         raw p-values or false discovery rates, respectively, depending on the value
         of `fdr_correction`.

    and a dictionary to `adata.uns`

       * `adata.uns["{key_added}]`: A dictionary holding the parameters this
         function was called with.
