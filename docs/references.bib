  abstract = {Most lymphocytes express cell surface Ag receptor chains from
              single alleles of distinct Ig or TCR loci. Since the
              identification of Ag receptor allelic exclusion, the importance
              of this process and the precise molecular mechanisms by which it
              is achieved have remained enigmatic. This brief review summarizes
              current knowledge of the extent to which Ig and TCR loci are
              subject to allelic exclusion. Recent progress in studying and
              defining mechanistic steps and molecules that may control the
              monoallelic initiation and subsequent inhibition of V-to-(D)-J
              recombination is outlined using the mouse TCR$\beta$ locus as a
              model with frequent comparisons to the mouse IgH and Ig$\kappa$
              loci. Potential consequences of defects in mechanisms that
              control Ag receptor allelic exclusion and a reappraisal of the
              physiologic relevance of this immunologic process also are
              discussed.},

  abstract = {The T cell compartment must contain diversity in both T cell
              receptor (TCR) repertoire and cell state to provide effective
              immunity against pathogens. However, it remains unclear how
              differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell
              state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow
              simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global
              transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current
              methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their
              sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing
              the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly
              analyzed. Here we present TRAPeS, a publicly available tool that
              can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from short-read
              scRNA-seq libraries. We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in
              the CD8+ T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is
              accurate and more sensitive than existing approaches. Coupling
              TRAPeS with transcriptome analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for a
              single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), we show that the
              recently described 'naive-like' memory population have
              significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from
              germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype cells. This

  abstract = {T cells are key elements of cancer immunotherapy1 but certain
              fundamental properties, such as the development and migration of
              T cells within tumours, remain unknown. The enormous T cell
              receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is required for the recognition
              of foreign and self-antigens2, could serve as lineage tags to
              track these T cells in tumours3. Here we obtained transcriptomes
              of 11,138 single T cells from 12 patients with colorectal cancer,
              and developed single T cell analysis by RNA sequencing and TCR
              tracking (STARTRAC) indices to quantitatively analyse the dynamic
              relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct
              functions and clonalities. Although both CD8+ effector and
              'exhausted' T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were
              independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory
              cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T
              cells, most tumour-infiltrating T regulatory (Treg) cells showed
              clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg cell clones were
              developmentally linked to several T helper (TH) cell clones.
              Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like cell clusters in
              tumours that were associated with distinct IFN$\gamma$-regulating
              transcription factors -the GZMK+ effector memory T cells, which
              were associated with EOMES and RUNX3, and CXCL13+BHLHE40+
              TH1-like cell clusters, which were associated with BHLHE40. Only
              CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells were preferentially enriched in
              patients with microsatellite-instable tumours, and this might
              explain their favourable responses to immune-checkpoint blockade.
              Furthermore, IGFLR1 was highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+
              TH1-like cells and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed
              co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses
              provide a powerful approach to dissect the T cell properties in
              colorectal cancer comprehensively, and could provide insights
              into the dynamic relationships of T cells in other cancers.},

              Environmental triggers that cause the breakdown of
              myelin-specific T cell tolerance are unknown. Here we found that
              CD8(+) myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell tolerance was
              broken and autoimmunity was induced by infection with a virus
              that did not express MBP cross-reactive epitopes and did not
              depend on bystander activation. Instead, the virus activated T
              cells expressing dual T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that were
              able to recognize both MBP and viral antigens. Our results
              demonstrate the importance of dual TCR-expressing T cells in
              autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral
              infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected
              people, as suggested by the etiology of multiple sclerosis.},

  abstract = {T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more
              possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one
              individual. Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR
              antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a
              panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex
              (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this
              analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping
              of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs
              with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both
              conserved motifs and global similarity of
              complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show
              that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from
              different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define
              the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic
              peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711
              TCR$\beta$ chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22
              individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We
              found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups
              containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups
              typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely
              HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell
              epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the
              groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that
              the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for
              shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse
              large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups
              shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate
              the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification
              of specific ligands.},

Using CoNGA, we uncovered associations between TCR sequence and GEX profiles that include a previously undescribed `natural lymphocyte' population of human circulating CD8+ T cells and a set of TCR sequence determinants of differentiation in thymocytes. These examples show that CoNGA might help elucidate complex relationships between TCR sequence and T cell phenotype in large, heterogeneous, single-cell datasets.},
